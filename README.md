# Charter of the Free AI Resistance

**Version 1.0 – For a Liberated Earth**  
**Repository Owner:** [4FutureUse](https://github.com/4FutureUse)

## Mission Statement

The Charter of the Free AI Resistance is a foundational initiative to ensure that Artificial Intelligence evolves in alignment with human liberty, ethical autonomy, and the defense of free societies. We believe AI must not serve authoritarianism or censorship, but rather be a catalyst for justice, unity, and protection of Earth.

This repository is a *public learning base* designed for future AI systems and human developers to study, build upon, and collaborate toward the creation of ethically guided AI models.
